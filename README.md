# About the Project 
I was given the task to analyze a dataset for the capstone project at the completion of my Merit America program. This project serves as a culmination of my learning experience, where I applied the skills and knowledge gained throughout the program. It aims to provide actionable insights into user behaviors and patterns based on Fitbit fitness data. By analyzing this dataset, I hope to uncover trends that can inform stakeholders and contribute to better health and wellness recommendations. 
# The Data 
For my project, I chose the Bellabeat dataset, which is comprised of 18 separate datasets on Fitbit fitness data, generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. Thirty users consented to the submission of personal tracker data. I imported 12 Excel datasheets with millions of entries into BigQuery and used SQL functions to clean the datasets and prepare them for analysis. So far, I have focused on cleaning the data, converting attributes to the proper data types, and preparing the datasets for further analysis. The next steps will involve joining the datasets, performing the analysis, and developing visualizations using the ggplot2 package in R to provide meaningful insights for stakeholders.
